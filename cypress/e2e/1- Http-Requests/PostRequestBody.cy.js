//! There are 3 different ways in which we can create a post request body
//* 1: we can hard code the data as part of the post request
//* 2: we can dynamically or randomly generate the data
//* 3: By using fixture concept in cypress

//* we will use this api "https://reqres.in/api/users" to create a new record.
/* {
    "name": "morpheus",
    "job": "leader"
   }           */ 
   
//* we will send request like this but we have to change the name in order to create a new record.
