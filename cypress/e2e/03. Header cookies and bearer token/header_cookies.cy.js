//! headers, cookies, bearer Token 
//* as part of the header we can pass token, sometimes cookies along with the request
//! so i will use an API, which by sending request to will generate token.
//! Note: the email should be different every time you hit the API. & the token will be generated.
//! that token will be used as bearer token to send other type of requests which belong to the same API.

//* after creating the token you can place order with it. by passing it as a bearer token in the request.
//* you can also view the placed order by following the url with the order ID.
//* first we will get token --> place an order --> view or get placed order
